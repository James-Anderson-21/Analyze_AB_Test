Data Analysis with A/B Test Results

The project attached utilizes Python to analyze a dataset regarding a fictional e-commerce website's new proposed changes.  The goal of the project is to determine if the new change should be implemented by evaluating the efficiency of "converting" users to paying for the product offered.  This project was completed in accordance with a data analytics nanodegree with Udacity as part of my Bachelor's degree in Data Analytics and Management through Western Governor's University.
